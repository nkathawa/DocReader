# DocReader
This project takes in a document and yields useful information about the words in it.

## Get it working
in your terminal: \
`git clone https://github.com/nkathawa/DocReader.git` \
`cd DocReader`

You can use the compiled `program` and run `./program` \
Or compile with `g++ -o program DocReader.cpp` and run `./program`

The program will prompt for the filename, use the `gettysburg_address.txt` file or bring in your own file.
